## Overview
Add or replace license/copyright boilerplate in source code files.

All contiguous comment blocks (bounded by empty or code lines) that contain a copyright message are stripped before injecting the new message.

You should commit all your code into a repo before running this program and check the results with a diff utility.

## Features
* Autodetect language from extension or shebang or header.
* Force programming language to use if files cannot be autodetected.
* Specify list of files to process.
* Recursive or non-recursive processing from current or specific path.
* Custom templates loadable from a JSON file.
* Specify author(s), year(s), program and short description.
* Include or exclude files or directories with wildcards or regex.
* Append to file or insert after any contiguous header comment block.
* Control left-hand margin padding and newline spacing.
* JSON config file ingestion for repeated or automated use, overridden by command-line options.
* Multi or single line comment style, such as /* */ vs. //.
* Quiet mode to suppress printing of altered files.
* Languages currently supported: C/C++, Java, HTML, Shell/Bash/Csh/Ksh/Tcsh/Zsh, Perl, Python, SQL, XML
* Python 2 and 3.

## Examples

Process current directory recursively and autodetect files.

    $ copyright -c config.json

Process files matching wildcards, appending to end of file.

    $ copyright -a 'Joe Smith' -p MyApp -l mit -i '*.py,foo*.h,script?' --back

Use custom template.

    $ copyright -c config.json -t my_templates.json --license my-license-2.0

## Installation

With PyPI.

    $ pip install copyright

With tarball.

    $ python setup.py install

## Testing

    $ make test

## FAQ
Q1. How can you keep multiple licenses in a file?<br>
A1. One strategy is to create a custom templates file that has all the licenses merged into one key/value pair, and then process your specific list of files.
